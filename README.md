-	In this project both RTQ and async thunk were used for state management and it is a very good project to understand this well.
-	This project is perfectly example project data necessary data has been pulled by using Axios.(I mean, we have created relational database and when we open the accordion we only use related user albums and photos, there is no unnecessary REST requests)
-	Reusable React component design
-	Architectural flexibility.
-	Skeleton Design for general Loading State, Animation design for button Loading States.( For example an add button has ben its Loading State animation, Local Fine-Grained Loading State has been used.)
